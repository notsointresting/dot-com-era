## My Star Trek 90s Website - Read Me!

Hey everyone!

So, Codedex had this cool holiday hackathon, and I just had to join in. I picked the "personal project" thing because I really wanted to build a Star Trek fan website. But there's a catch: it had to be 90s style, so I did my best to make it feel like those old, kinda weird internet days.

**You can check it out here:** [https://notsointresting.github.io/dot-com-era/startrek-hq-website/](https://notsointresting.github.io/dot-com-era/startrek-hq-website/)

**What you'll find here (Star Trek style):**

Imagine if people in the 90s were super into Star Trek, and this was their site. That's kinda what I was going for:

*   **Star Trek 90s Look:** Think lots of bright colors and pixel art, cheesy transitions for Star Trek, and a place where you could leave a message about Star Trek!
*   **Star Trek Stuff:** It's got Star Trek episodes, movies, and all the other series. You can check out all the Star Trek seasons and even clips from Star Trek.
*   **Secret Star Trek:** I've hidden a secret Star Trek area somewhere. You might find it if you look around like it's a Star Trek episode!
*   **Star Trek in the 90s:** There's even a part about UFO sightings from the 90s, because what's a 90s website without some alien stuff, right?
*   **Star Trek's Faces:** You will see all the cast member of Star Trek.
*   **Star Trek Game:** There is a secret Star Trek space game to give you that old gaming vibe.
*    **Star Trek Quotes:** Quotes from spock can be seen all over Star Trek website.

**How to Explore (Star Trek-style):**

Just click on stuff. You never know what Star Trek thing you might find.

**What I Learned (And Some Star Trek Stuff I'm Happy About)**

This was a ton of fun, I got to play with how websites looked way back when. I liked:

*   Trying to make the Star Trek site feel old-school but still easy to use.
*   Putting my love of Star Trek together with those crazy 90s looks.
*   Making it interactive, so it's more than just a boring page for Star Trek!

**Some Things to Keep in Mind (Because Even Star Trek Has Flaws)**

*   Don't expect it to be too perfect.
*   It's supposed to look like a 90s Star Trek page, so if it looks a bit strange, that's on purpose.

I'm excited to share this Star Trek website with everyone. Have fun looking around! Let me know what you think about it.

ðŸ–– Live long and prosper ðŸ–– (and have fun checking out the Star Trek site!)
